Now, we need to sync messages is's between two users during the conversation. We have the function message_reaction_handler. Here we receive a reaction from the user. We have the message ID on which that reaction was given. 

We also have @Conversation class representing Conversations table in the database. We need to select the row from the database where user1_id is equal to message_reaction.chat.id and where is_active is true. Then we need the user2_id from this row.
