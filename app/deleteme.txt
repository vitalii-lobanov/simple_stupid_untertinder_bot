Ok. Now, let's do some refactoring. We have two models in ./models â€” message.py and profile_data_tiered_message.py. They provide Message and ProfileDataTieredMessage classes respectively. In fact, both classes represent the same entity from the real world: a Telegram message sent to the bot.  I want to reorganize the way how the bot stores data. I want to send all the messages from all the users received in any cases in one table. Then I want tow separate table: 

1. The first connects the users' profiles and the messages that the users send during the registration process (Users table and Messages table).
2. The second connects the users' profiles, the conversations and the messages. 

How can I achieve that? 

The database doesn't content any valuable data, so we do not need the migration, just recreate the database from scratch.
