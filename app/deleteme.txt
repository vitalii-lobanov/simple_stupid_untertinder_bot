But how is recommended to handle the scenarios where we know that the flag in the database may or even should change, but do not know when? In current project it may be for example during users' matching for chatting. Asume, the first user, Alice, sends /start_chatting command and there is no partners for conversation at the moment. Then, the second user, Bob runs /start_chatting command too. The bot handles bob's command but cannot set Alice's context to state chatting_in_progress. What the best practices for such situations?
